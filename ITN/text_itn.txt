PROJECT BACKGROUND

In recent years the computational complexity of mathematical models employed in financial mathematics
has witnessed a tremendous growth. [b]Advanced numerical techniques[/b] are imperative for the
most present-day applications in financial industry.

The motivation for this training network is the need for a network of highly educated European scientists
in the field of financial mathematics and computational science, so as to exchange and discuss
current insights and ideas, and to lay groundwork for future collaborations.

Besides a series of internationally recognized researchers from academics, leading quantitative analysts
from the financial industry also participate in this network. The challenge lies in the necessity of
[b]combining transferable techniques and skills[/b] such as mathematical analysis, sophisticated numerical
methods and stochastic simulation methods with deep qualitative and quantitative understanding
of mathematical models arising from financial markets.

The main training objective is to prepare, at the highest possible level, young researchers with a broad
scope of scientific knowledge and to teach  [b]transferable skills, like social awareness[/b] which is very
important in view of the recent financial crises.

The current topic in this network is that the  [b]financial crisis in the European countries[/b] 
is a  [b]contagion and herding effect[/b] and is clearly outside of the domain of validity of Black-Scholes and Mertonâ€™s
theory, since the  [b]market is not Gaussian and it is not frictionless and complete[/b].

In this research training network our aim is to [b]deeper understand complex (mostly nonlinear)
financial models and to develop effective and robust numerical schemes for solving linear and
nonlinear problems[/b] arising from the mathematical theory of pricing financial derivatives and related
financial products. This aim will be accomplished by means of financial modelling, mathematical
analysis and numerical simulations, optimal control techniques and validation of models.
